<h4> Why Though?</h4>
    <p><font size="2" class="Times">
        Network Security and Information Technology is on the raise, and it has been ever since it was created.
        I feel that's a safe assumption. We are sometimes thrown into a job with little to no knowledge about
        the technology or software that is expected to learn. As the desire for technology rises, the demand
        for knownledgeable individuals is as well. I hope to provide you some useful tips and tools to help
        In your IT adventure. I myself have spent a little over a year studying Tech and I hope to learn more.
