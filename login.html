<h4>{|}Why is Information Technology so important?{|}</h4>
    <p><font size="2" class="Times">
        Network Security and Information Technology is on the raise and it has been ever since it was created.
        We are sometimes thrown into a job with little to no knowledge about
        the technology or software that is expected. As the desire for technology rises, the demand
        for knownledgeable individuals will as well. Hopefully, this webpage can provide some useful tips and tools to help
        in any IT adventure. The <b>FIRST</b> recommendation would be to pick up any Linux Distribution.<br><br>
        There are so many different flavors of <a href="www.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions"> Linux.</a>
        Or if your favorite is already decided, check out this <a href="/irqgdb/irqgdb.github.io/research.html">link</a> to get a Linux USB bootdrive setup and working.

<h4>{|}Websites are too complicated{|}</h4>
    <p><font size="2" class="Times">
        Do you wish

        Hopefully most questions will be in this research article <a href="/irqgdb/irqgdb.github.io/research.html">here.</a>
        It's really <b>not</b> as complicated as it seems.

<h4> {|}Paying for School{|} </h4>
        <p><font size="2" class="Times">
          Technically, someone can get a job in IT with enough work. If you are a dedicated individual than you can teach yourself most tools of the trade.
          If you are more of a hands on or visual learner some prefer to get certificates or degrees in computer science, or in a like field.
          A great way to pay for school could be to search if the state has any stipend avaliabler.
It's worth a shot, go to the <a href="">FASFA website</a> and apply for financial aid.
